# Login Methods

Learn about MindKey's login methods. The following login methods are supported in version 5.10:

## Username and Password:

Login is done with a username and a password generated by MindKey. This method can be extended with MFA (Multifactor Authentication), which requires approval via an authentication app on the user's mobile phone. There are no restrictions on the choice of authentication apps or the phones from which the selected authentication app can be used. All apps that implement RFC 6238 and can be configured with an OTPAuth schema encrypted with a QR code can be used. Possible authentication apps include, for instance, Microsoft Authenticator and Google Authenticator.

## Azure AD (Active Directory):

Azure AD is a cloud service from Microsoft, and the customer must have an Azure subscription with a configured Azure AD. There are no special setup requirements for Azure AD, the version of Windows Server OS, or other software. The process can be done by an Azure AD Administrator alone who is allowed to log in to MindKey. The customer's Azure AD Administrator provides the Azure AD Directory ID for MindKey, which records this on the customer's CustomerTenant table in the Mindkey database, as follows:

In Azure Portal, select Azure Active Directory, select Properties, copy the value in the Directory Id field and submit it to MindKey.  
By associating the customer's Azure Directory ID with the MindKey license, it can be ensured that only the customer's users can log in.

To complete the setup, follow these steps:

1. Start MindKey, and a login screen will open with username and password fields and the Azure AD button.
2. Click the Azure AD button, and a login screen with username and password fields will appear.
3. Enter the username (including @ domain, e.g., example@mindkey.com) and the password provided by the customer's IT department.
4. If the user's Directory Id does not match what was sent to and registered by MindKey, or if it is missing, the login attempt is rejected.
5. If the user's Directory Id matches what is registered by MindKey, a dialog will open allowing MindKey to access the client's Azure AD. An Azure AD Administrator must now click on the link and sign in to grant this permission.
6. For subsequent logins, customer users can simply click on the Azure AD button in the MindKey login dialog to open MindKey.

<Note>Different login processes can be used for external users and employees. It will be possible to use a username and password with Azure AD so that externals, for instance, can log in with a username and password, and employees sign in with the user created by the customer's IT department.</Note>
